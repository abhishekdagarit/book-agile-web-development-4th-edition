The application here is from the book “Agile web development with Rails 4th edition”. In order to learn the language and how it works, I followed through the book to make myself an application. The application is of a bookstore, a “Pragmatic Bookstore” to be precise.

Till now I have covered till the point of added AJAX speciality to the code.

Soon this application will be complete.
